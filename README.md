# Trilium Scripts
This is a collection of scripts I made for the awesome note-taking platform [Trilium](https://github.com/zadam/trilium).

These are all quick, one-file programs solely for use in Trilium; code neatness wasn't exactly a priority. However, I comment almost everything in case you'd like to edit them.

## Installation
Check the [wiki](https://github.com/Mangiola/trilium-scripts/wiki) for installation and usage guides.
